# Quick Start
1. Create your own card by subclassing `MGSwipeCard`. Our card simply displays an image.

    ```swift
    class SampleCard: MGSwipeCard {
        init(model: SampleCardModel) {
            self.content = UIImageView(image: model.image)
        }
    }
    
    struct SampleCardModel {
        var image: UIImage
    }
    ```

2. Add a `MGCardStackView` to your view and implement to the protocol `MGCardStackViewDataSource` (make sure to set your card stack's `dataSource` property).

    ```swift
    class ViewController: UIViewController {
        let cardStack = MGCardStackView()
        
        var cardModels: [SampleCardModel] = [
            SampleCardModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage1")),
            SampleCardModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage2")),
            SampleCardModel(image: UIImage(named: "cardImage3"))
        ]
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            view.addSubview(cardStack)
            cardStack.frame = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bounds.insetBy(dx: 10, dy: 50)
            cardStack.dataSource = self
        }
    }

    //MARK: - Data Source Methods
	
        extension ViewController: MGCardStackViewDataSource {
	     func numberOfCards() -> Int {
	         return cards.count
	     }
        
	     func card(forItemAtIndex index: Int) -> MGSwipeCard {
	         return SampleCard(model: cardModels[index])
	     }
    }
    ```
    
3. Happy swiping!

# Architecture
There are two major components in the `MGSwipeCards` framework. The first is the `MGCardStackView` which displays the cards. It is responsible for managing the lifetime of the cards. The second component is the cards themselves. Each draggable `MGSwipeCard` contains the swipe logic and is responsible for notifying the card stack of a registered swipe.

## `MGCardStackView`
To use a `MGCardStackView`, add it to your view and implement the `MGCardStackViewDataSource` protocol. Once the card stack's data source is set, the cards you provided will automatically be loaded. `MGCardStackView` exposes the following variables:

```swift
var delegate: MGCardStackViewDelegate?
var dataSource: MGCardStackViewDataSource?

var numberOfVisibleCards: Int = 2
var topCardIndex: Int

var cardStackInsets: UIEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(top: 10, left: 10, bottom: 10, right: 10)
var animationOptions: CardStackAnimationOptions = .defaultOptions
```

### Useful Methods
The following methods can be accessed from within `MGCardStackView`.

#### Swipe
Performs a swipe programmatically in the given direction. Any delegate methods are called as usual.

```swift
func swipe(_ direction: SwipeDirection)
```

![Shift](Images/swipe.gif)

#### Undo
Restores the card stack to its state before the last swipe.

```swift
func undoLastSwipe()
```

![Shift](Images/undo.gif)

#### Shift
Shifts the card stack's cards by the given distance. Any previously swiped cards are skipped over.

```swift
func shift(withDistance distance: Int = 1, animated: Bool)
```

![Shift](Images/shift.gif)

### Custom Layouts
While the default card stack layout works great for a quick implementation, you can achieve your own layout by overriding the following method:

```swift
func transformForCard(at index: Int) -> CGAffineTransform
```
For all card stack layouts, the background cards will animate to their next position in response to any of the actions listed above.

### Data Source & Delegates
To populate your card stack, you must conform your view controller to the `MGCardStackViewDataSource` protocol and implement the following required functions:

```swift
func numberOfCards(in cardStack: MGCardStackView) -> Int
func cardStack(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView, cardForIndexAt index: Int) -> MGSwipeCard
```
Once your card stack's `dataSource` property is set, your card stack will automatically be populated. 

To react to swipes and other related events, you must conform your view controller to the `MGCardStackViewDelegate` protocol. The protocol contains the following (optional) methods:

```swift
func didSwipeAllCards(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView)
func cardStack(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView, didSwipeCardAt index: Int, with direction: SwipeDirection)
func cardStack(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView, didUndoCardAt index: Int, from direction: SwipeDirection)
func cardStack(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView, didSelectCardAt index: Int)
func cardStack(_ cardStack: MGCardStackView, didSelectCardAt index: Int, tapCorner: UIRectCorner)
```

**NOTE:** The `didSwipeCardAt` and `didSwipeAllCards ` methods are called regardless if a card was swiped programmatically or by the user.

## `MGSwipeCard`
The `MGSwipeCard` is a UIView with added gesture recognizers to handle swipe recognition and achieve the visual drag effect. It is also responsible for informing its parent card stack of a registered (or cancelled) swipe. To use a `MGSwipeCard `, we recommend you create a subclass of it and initialize your card's appearance following the instructions in the section below.

Each `MGSwipeCard` exposes the following properties:

```swift
var swipeDirections = SwipeDirection.allDirections

var content: UIView?
var footer: UIView?

var leftOverlay: UIView?
var upOverlay: UIView?
var rightOverlay: UIView?
var downOverlay: UIView?

var isFooterTransparent: Bool = false
var footerHeight: CGFloat = 100

var animationOptions: CardAnimationOptions = .defaultOptions
```

### Card Appearance
Each `MGSwipeCard` consists of three UI components: its *content view*, *footer view*, and *overlay view(s)*.

#### Content
The content view is the card's primary view. You can include your own card template here. The content view is set assigning the `content` variable.

#### Footer
The card's footer view is set just below the card's content view. To have the card's content continue past the footer view, set `isFooterTransparent` is to `true`. The footer's height is modified with `footerHeight`. The card's footer is set by assigning the `footer` variable.

#### Overlays
An overlay view is a view whose alpha value reacts to the user's dragging. The overlays are laid out above the card's footer, regardless if the footer is transparent or not. The card's overlays are set by assigning the `leftOverlay`, `upOverlay`, `rightOverlay`, and `downOverlay` variables.


### `MGDraggableSwipeView`
Each `MGSwipeCard` is a subclass of `MGDraggableSwipeView`. It is here that the swipe recognition settings can be modified. The following properties of `MGDraggableSwipeView ` are available:

```swift
var minimumSwipeSpeed: CGFloat = 1100
var minimumSwipeMargin: CGFloat = 0.5
var maximumRotationAngle: CGFloat = CGFloat.pi / 10
```
The default values have been optimized to feel natural to the user.
